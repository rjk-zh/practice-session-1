 <h1> SIX STAGES OF LIFE </h1>

 <div class = "container"> 
    <div class = "stage"> 
    <h3> The welcoming </h3>

    <p> just born , you shine with unbridled potential. You know nothing of this world and its cruelties , you stay alone in the protection of your mother...you're truly happy , even if you're unaware of what happiness is. </p>
    </div>
    <div class = "stage">
    <h3> The upcoming </h3>
    <p> you start to learn about the world around you, you start to walk and talk, you start to understand the meaning of happiness, but also sadness. You are still protected by your parents, but you start to feel the first signs of independence. </p>
    </div>

 
    <div class = "stage">
    <h3> the understanding </h3>
    <p> you start to understand the world around you, you start to make friends, you start to learn about love and hate, you start to feel the first signs of responsibility. You are still protected by your parents, but you start to feel the first signs of independence. </p>
    </div>

    <div class = "stage">
    <h3> The " what the fuck is this ? </h3>

    <p> the world comes undone right in front of your eyes. you are left with a sense of belonging no more. too smart to stay in the shed of your parents and not smart enough to figure it out on your own. You float , like a lost cloud , waiting to rain on. </p>
    </div>

    <div class = "stage">
    <h3> The forthcoming </h3>
    <p> the cloud grows , it learns , it moulds , it adapts. it's almost unrecognisable. It still sees traces of its younger self in the mirror sometimes , in his loved ones...but he smiles it off , the cloud floats.</p>
    </div>

    <div class = "stage">
    <h3> The resting </h3>
    <p> A life has passed , all the experiences , the memories , the laughs , they all come to an end quite abruptly , almost unfair.....but is it an end, or merely a new beginning?</p>
